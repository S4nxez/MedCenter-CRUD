# Class Project Repository

This repository contains projects developed during the third term of Markup Languajes. The purpose of this repository is to showcase both basic exercises and a more elaborate final assignment. The structure is as follows:

## Introduction

This repository was created as part of a class to demonstrate my learning progress in JavaScript and web development. It includes basic review exercises and a comprehensive final project.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **SpringBootMeds**: Contains the server.
- **finalAssignment**: Contains the final project which is more complex and feature-rich.

## Review Exercises

The `reviewExercises` folder includes a collection of basic JavaScript exercises designed to reinforce fundamental concepts. These exercises are not the main focus of this repository but are included for completeness.

## Final Assignment

### Overview

The `finalAssignment` folder contains a project that simulates a patient management system. This project includes two HTML files and a `js` folder containing three JavaScript files.

### Setup

To run the final project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `finalAssignment` folder.
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

### Functionality

The final assignment features a login form that validates credentials against an external server (not developed as part of this project). Upon successful login, the user is redirected to a main page (`main.html`) that displays a CRUD table of patients. Credentials are user:root pwd:quevedo2dam

#### Features:

- **Add Patient**: Allows the addition of new patients to the table.
- **Modify Patient**: Enables editing of patient details.
- **Delete Patient**: Permits the removal of patients from the table.
- **Get Info**: Displays detailed medical records for each patient in a separate table, with options to add, modify, and delete records.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to implement a functional web application with user authentication, data management, and interactive features. I look forward to any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
