# Spring Boot Microservices with PostgreSQL

A Spring Boot application demonstrating microservices architecture, server requests, and PostgreSQL database integration. Developed as part of a comprehensive course, this project serves as a practical example of building Java-based web applications.

## Overview

This repository contains a microservice developed using Spring Boot, which interacts with a PostgreSQL database to demonstrate data persistence and retrieval.

## Features

- **Microservices**: The project is organized into separate microservices, each responsible for a specific functionality.

- **HTTP Endpoints**: The microservices expose RESTful APIs with endpoints for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting data.

- **PostgreSQL Database**: Data is stored and retrieved from a PostgreSQL database, highlighting database integration within Spring Boot applications.

## Technologies Used

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot): A powerful framework for building Java-based web applications.

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): An open-source relational database management system.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project locally on your development machine.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) - Version 11 or higher
- PostgreSQL Database

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SringBootCourse.git
   
2. Configure your PostgreSQL database connection in the application.properties files of each microservice.

3. Build and run each microservice using Maven or your preferred IDE.

4. Access the microservice via its respective endpoints.

### Usage

- Once you have configurated the database as told above you can send requests by generating the http file on IntelliJ.
